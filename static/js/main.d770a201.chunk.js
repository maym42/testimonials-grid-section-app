I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I\u2019ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! \u201d"}],d=a(4),f=a.n(d),m=a(1),u=a.n(m),h=a(0);var p=function(e){var t="img"+(e.index+1);return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:u.a.person,children:[Object(h.jsx)("img",{id:u.a[t],className:u.a.personImg,src:e.picPath,alt:e.fullName+"-img"}),Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:u.a.personDetails,children:[Object(h.jsx)("h1",{className:u.a.fullName,children:e.fullName}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{className:u.a.certification,children:e.certification})]})]})},g=a(7),j=a.n(g);var b=function(e){return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:j.a.content,children:[Object(h.jsx)("h2",{children:e.qute}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:e.fullText})]})};var _=function(e){var t="card"+(e.index+1);return Object(h.jsxs)("article",{id:f.a[t],className:f.a.card,children:[Object(h.jsx)("figure",{}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{index:e.index,picPath:e.picPath,fullName:e.fullName,certification:e.certification}),Object(h.jsx)(b,{qute:e.qute,fullText:e.fullText})]})},x=a(8),v=a.n(x);var w=function(e){return Object(h.jsxs)("footer",{className:v.a.attribution,children:["Challenge by"," ",Object(h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:"Frontend Mentor"}),".
